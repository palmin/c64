# c64
Realtime video filter that simulates 16 color c64 palette

This is toy project made some years ago, that shows a quick way to reduce image to 
fixed palette by doing lookup directly on a texture with optional dithering.

This lets palette reduction run in realtime on the camera feed.

The project is not actively being developed, but if you have any questions you can ask [@palmin](https://twitter.com/palmin) on Twitter.
